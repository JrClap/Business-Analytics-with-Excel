# Business-Analytics-with-Excel

üîπ Why this project matters:
In today‚Äôs business world, data-driven decision-making is a critical skill. This project showcases how Excel can be used to solve complex business problems, from basic budgeting to resource optimization and forecasting. Using management science techniques, I modeled real-world scenarios that help companies improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance strategic planning.

üß† Key sections of the project:

1)Budgeting & Financial Analysis
- Net income, expense, and savings calculations.
- Project profitability analysis (NPV, ROI).

2) Forecasting & Regression
- Linear, power, and exponential models for demand prediction.
- Comparing model accuracy with MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

3) Linear & Integer Programming
- Production, transportation, and resource allocation optimization.
- Solving distribution problems (e.g., minimizing logistics costs).

4) What-If Analysis
- Evaluating the impact of parameter changes on profit and other metrics.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Methods:
- Excel (formulas, pivot tables, Solver, Data Tables).
- Modeling: Linear regression, NPV, transportation problems, assignment problems.
- Visualization: Charts, heatmaps, dynamic reports.

üòÖ Challenges & Solutions:
- Data Integration: Merging disparate tables with different formats.
- Optimization: Configuring Solver for nonlinear problems with constraints.
- Model Validation: Ensuring forecast accuracy and calculation correctness.

üéØ Outcome:
- Ready-to-use templates for financial planning, forecasting, and optimization.
- Hands-on experience applying Excel to complex business problems.
